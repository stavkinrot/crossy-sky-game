# Crossy Sky
This is a simplified, sky version of the famous "Crossy Road" game I created. Instead of avoiding cars, you avoid hostile eagles and level up each time you successfully reach the top of the screen. The difficulty increases with each level!
## Usage:
- Make sure to have pygame installed.

- Please make sure you have all the files in the same folder.

- Please read the game instructions, either here or by hovering over the eagle in the menu screen.

### Game Instructions:
1. Use left/right to change bird.
2. Press UP to choose your bird and fly.
3. Fly with the arrow keys. Fly to any cloud to start the game:
    - White Cloud - easy mode
    - Rain Cloud - normal
    - Storm Cloud - hard mode

4. Avoid the eagles and cross the sky. It gets harder with each successful crossing. Good luck!
